# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Figs folder

The figs directory contains the figures. This directory only contains generated files; that is, one should always be able to delete the contents and regenerate them.

## Contents

Two figures are produced by `Project1.qmd`

`categories_by_pos.png` is the first and answers "Question 1" of the project.
`relative_freq_vs_avg.html` is the second and answers "Question 2".
Since the second figure is an interactable `plotly` graph, it also comes with the `relative_freq_vs_avg_files` folder for the Javasript functionality of the the plot to work.
