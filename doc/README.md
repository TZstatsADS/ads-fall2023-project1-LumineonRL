Note: Some users have reported a bug with the version of one of the packages this script uses, `quarto`.

Simply running `install.packages("quarto")` will have R install version 1.3.343 of the package which contains the issue that causes one of the charts in my project to not render properly.

I recommend heading over to https://quarto.org/docs/download/ and installing version `1.3.450` to ensure you can reproduce the entirty of `Project1.qmd`.
