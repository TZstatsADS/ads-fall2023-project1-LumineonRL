# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

## Contents

Contains 3 helper functions used throughout `Project1.qmd`

- `dark_theme.R` is a custom dark theme for `ggplot`
- `directory_cleanup.R` moves files to the `output` directory after `Project1.qmd` finishes
- `load_data.R` loads the relevant `.csv` files from the `data` directory.
